0.1.0
    Features:
        - regex parsing
        - file renaming base on parsed regex
        - does not overwrite an existing file by default (can be overidden by '-f' flag)

    Notes:
        - currently handles file paths as absolute paths internallyâ€” where regex application happens; might want to change this later
