## DGS Results
 - "renm" tries to apply regex-matching to an entire path
     - it does NOT attempt to match the full ABSOLUTE path, but rather the entirety of whatever path it is directly supplied
        - e.g.  given cmd `renm a A f-alpha d-a/f-delta`:
            - `f-alpha` tries to become `f-AlphA`
            - `d-a` tries to become `d-A`
            - `f-delta` tries to become `f-deltA`
     - this needs to be fixed so that only FILENAMES (NOT full PATHS) are run thru regex-matching
 - "renm" doesn't work thru dirs recursively
     - this is in line w/ other programs w/ similar applications, & therefore doesn't need to chg
     - adding optional recursive file renaming via a `-r` flag in the future could be a good idea, though
 - "renm" DOES move DIRECTORIES when directly supplied them
     - it does NOT properly move any files within said directory(s), even when supplied them directly
 - "renm" DOES move files within directories; provided the directory itself is NOT matched w/ the regex, and the file's relative path has been directly supplied
